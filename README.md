# Metaballs simulation

<img src="./preview/preview.gif"></img>

**Metaballs** _(Not to be confused with Meatballs)_ In computer graphics, metaballs are organic-looking n-dimensional isosurfaces, characterised by their ability to meld together when in close proximity to create single, contiguous objects.

This simulation uses <b>marching squares</b> to draw the blobby shapes. <b>Processing 4</b> was used to create it.

See _references_ for more info on how the simulation works.

## Running the program

[Processing 4](https://processing.org/download) is
needed to run the program through source code.
